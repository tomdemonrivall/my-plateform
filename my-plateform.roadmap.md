### How will I make this plateforme stand out

Bulk Ideas :
- One interactive page, the more you look the more you find
- fractale way of reading, cf [https://www.adhamdannaway.com/](https://www.adhamdannaway.com/) (or <a href="https://www.adhamdannaway.com/" target="_blank">adhamdannaway.com</a> to open in a new tab)
- the reader first see the most recent stuff, and have to progess on the tree to see old things
- minimalist style / color theme
- mousover + scroll = growing the targeted branch
- hidden text you need to mouseover to be able to read ?
- hidden command, growing fractale on the bg, of panorama / 360 vue moving with left ans right arrow, or ongoing slow mo lsd effect.
- movable part of the bg to reveal stuff
